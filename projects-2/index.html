It started with the question of how to analyze which data should be transmitted to the ground station in low-bandwidth missions. This is a common problem, especially when high-resolution images of planetary surfaces need to be transmitted. We have built an autonomous system that classifies ground images and marks important areas for transmission. To test the system, it was flown on a high altitude balloon in the REXUS/BEXUS program of DLR/SNSB and ESA. During almost two years of development, we were able to build a modular system with the ability to exchange sensors, collect processes and transfer data. We were guided by experts from DLR and ESA during several reviews all over Europe. In the end, we have our own piece of technology ready to launch from the Esrange Space Center. As expected, it was a very successful launch and we collected more than enough data to present the results at conferences. We would like to thank our sponsors and partners who made this experiment possible. After this exciting trip most of us finished our studies and started new projects. Some of us joined WüSpace e.V. in its founding phase to create a new base for exciting space-related projects in Würzburg. At the moment we are building a ground station system, a rocket tracker and a new descent mechanism.
